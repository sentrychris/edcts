## Development

The EDCS backend is built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and uses [MySQL](https://mysql.org/) for storage, [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching, and [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) for managing queue workers and long-running artisan commands.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used for local development.

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:

    ```sh
    git clone git@gitub.com:sentrychris/edcts.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    docker run --rm \
         -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
         -v "$(pwd):/var/www/html" \
         -w /var/www/html \
         laravelsail/php84-composer:latest \
         composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
    ```

3. Configure environment variables:

    ```sh
    ...
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=edcts-mysql-1 # name of the running db container
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=edcts
    DB_USERNAME=sail
    DB_PASSWORD=password

    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:4201 # used to redirect oauth

    FRONTIER_AUTH_URL=https://auth.frontierstore.net
    FRONTIER_CLIENT_ID=<your-frontier-oauth-client-id>
    FRONTIER_CLIENT_KEY=<your-frontier-oauth-client-key>
    FRONTIER_CAPI_URL=https://companion.orerve.net

    BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
    CACHE_DRIVER=database
    FILESYSTEM_DISK=local
    QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
    SESSION_DRIVER=database
    SESSION_LIFETIME=120

    REDIS_HOST=edcts-redis-1
    REDIS_PASSWORD=null
    REDIS_PORT=6379
    ... # the rest should be fine
    ```

4. Start the containers:

    ```sh
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```

5. Create the database tables:

    ```sh
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh
    ```

6. Seed populated systems, so that you have some data:

    1. Download the `systemsPopulated.json.gz` dump archive [from EDSM](https://www.edsm.net/dump/systemsPopulated.json.gz)
    2. Extract it to `storage/dumps/`
    3. Run the import command:
        ```sh
        ./vendor/bin/sail artisan import:dumpfile \
            --type systems \
            --channel import:system \
            --file systemsPopulated.json
        ```
    
    Please note, the `systemsPopulated.json` file is larger than 1GB. The `import:dumpfile` command will therefore split the file into parts and dispatch them as jobs to the worker queue.

7. Start the queue worker:
    ```sh
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan queue:work --deamon
    ```

8. Seed Galnet news articles:

    ```sh
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan import:galnet
    ```

9. Cache system statistics:

    ```sh
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan cache:stats
    ```
